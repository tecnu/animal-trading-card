				with white bellies and white and <br> black tails.  Their heads, bodies, tails and <br> limbs have narrow black,
				brown or gray <br> stripes.  There were once nine subspecies of <br> tigers: Bengal, Siberian, Indochinese, South <br> Chinese,
				Sumatran, Malayan, Caspian, <br> Javan and Bali.  Of these, the last three are <br> extinct, one is extinct in the wild, and the <br> rest are
